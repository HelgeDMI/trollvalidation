Welcome to trollvalidation's documentation!
===========================================

trollvalidation is a Python package for implementing validations
particularly of products derived meteorological satellite data.

trollvalidation does not provide a strict framework for implementing
validations. Instead, it is more a collection of helper functions and
-together with this documentation- provides a collection of best practices.
